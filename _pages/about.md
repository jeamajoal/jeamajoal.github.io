From the moment I stumbled upon the NIBBLES.BAS file on my dad's computer as a sixth grader and unlocked the magic of altering the game by tweaking the text, my fascination with the power of programming was ignited. That initial spark led me down a path of exploration and innovation in the realm of IT, a journey that began in the early 2000s on a small helpdesks.

Throughout my career, I've embraced the art of automation, applying it to both mundane tasks and complex challenges. My endeavors have ranged from programming for sheer enjoyment to implementing automation in professional settings, and more recently, focusing on leveraging these skills to enhance cybersecurity measures. This blend of passion, curiosity, and experience has not only shaped my professional identity but also enriched my understanding of the technological landscape.

As I embark on this new chapter with "Jeamajoal vs. Automation," I'm excited to share a collection of my work, insights, and experiences, while I study for my OSCP, and beyond. This blog serves me as a resource to help pivot my IT Engineering carreer into a IT Security carreer focussed on red teaming, and hopefully serves the reader as insightful, helpful, or entertaining content.
